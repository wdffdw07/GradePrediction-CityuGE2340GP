# GE2340 Desktop App

The Windows app wraps the existing [model explorer](../demo/README.md) with a custom GE2340 title bar and icon. It has no default application menu. The title bar supports dragging; the three buttons minimize, maximize/restore and close the window. Alt+F4 also closes it.

## Run the packaged app

Download [GE2340-Model-Explorer-1.1.0-Windows.exe](https://github.com/wdffdw07/GradePrediction-CityuGE2340GP/releases/download/v1.1.0/GE2340-Model-Explorer-1.1.0-Windows.exe) from [Release v1.1.0](https://github.com/wdffdw07/GradePrediction-CityuGE2340GP/releases/tag/v1.1.0), or use the local copy in the main `ge2340_data_package_v3` folder. It is a Windows x64 portable app; no Node.js, Python, browser or separate model installation is needed. Its initial launch extracts the bundled runtime into a temporary directory.

The app includes both fitted models and the same preprocessing and result displays as the browser demo. It opens with Jeffrey's classifier; the selector also provides linear regression. Predictions work offline. The source attribution link opens in the default browser when clicked.

The executable is not code-signed. A Windows reputation prompt may identify the publisher as unknown.

## Develop and package

From `app/desktop/`, with Node.js installed:

```powershell
npm ci
npm start
npm run test:desktop
npm run dist
```

Dependencies are pinned in `package-lock.json`. The desktop wrapper uses Electron 44.4.5 and electron-builder 26.18.0. Build output goes to the main `ge2340_data_package_v3` folder for this checkout. Once Electron is installed locally, packaging can also use the installed runtime:

```powershell
npm run dist -- --config.electronDist=node_modules/electron/dist
```

`main.cjs` owns the window and the restricted window-control IPC. `preload.cjs` exposes only window controls to the isolated renderer. The shared `app/demo/desktop-bar.js` and `app/demo/desktop.css` enable the custom title bar only inside the app; the HTML page continues to work in a browser.

The app loads local content with renderer sandboxing and context isolation. External navigation is limited to the existing dataset/license links. Application assets and the fitted model are packaged locally.

## Update the model or classifier

Edit the shared files in `../demo/`, following its adapter contract, then rebuild the executable. Classifier scripts and local model assets must be included by the `extraResources` filter in `package.json`. The current filter includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript; add another extension only if the new adapter needs it. The packaged executable does not automatically read changes from the source folder.

## Verification

`npm run test:desktop` checks the custom title bar, menu removal, isolated renderer, prediction updates and all window buttons. Its default output is `smoke-results/`; pass `-- --smoke-output=<absolute-path>` to choose another directory. The same `--smoke-test` and `--smoke-output` arguments work on the packaged executable.

Numerical checks are available from the package root with `node app/demo/test-models.cjs` and `node app/demo/test-classifier.cjs`. Before rebuilding an updated classifier, run `python app/demo/export_classifier.py` with the project dependencies installed.
